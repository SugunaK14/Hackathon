**Team:** The White Singularity  
**Team Leader:** Vidit (Shanaaya) Singh Gautam  
**Hackathon:** Google Cloud Gen AI Exchange Hackathon  
**Problem Statement:** AI Analyst for Startup Evaluation

## 🚀 Project Overview

VentureIQ is the world's first Multi-Agent Investment Analysis Platform that transforms startup due diligence from a 20-hour manual process into a 2-minute AI-powered analysis. Our platform revolutionizes how investors evaluate startup opportunities by deploying 5 specialized AI agents that work simultaneously like a complete investment committee.

## 💡 The Problem

Traditional startup due diligence is:
- **Time-consuming**: 20+ hours of manual analysis per startup
- **Inconsistent**: Human bias affects investment decisions
- **Resource-intensive**: Requires multiple analysts and extensive research
- **Limited scope**: Difficult to benchmark against comprehensive datasets

## 🎯 Our Solution

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Intelligence System
Five specialized AI agents working in parallel:

1. **Document Intelligence Agent** - Extracts financial data, team info, and metrics from pitch decks
2. **Market Research Agent** - Benchmarks against 500+ real startups with industry comparisons  
3. **Risk Assessment Agent** - Provides ML-powered success predictions and red flag detection
4. **Competitive Intelligence Agent** - Performs autonomous competitive research and positioning analysis
5. **Portfolio Impact Agent** - Models investment returns with scenario analysis and portfolio optimization

### 📊 Key Features
