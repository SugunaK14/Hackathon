# üå± CarbonTrack AI - Automated MRV for Smallholder Farmers

**Live Demo:** https://hackathon-m3es.onrender.com

**NABARD Hackathon 2025 Submission**

## Problem Statement

Current MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) systems for carbon credits are prohibitively expensive ($50-200/farmer/year) and too complex for India's 146 million smallholder farmers. This prevents their participation in carbon markets worth $2 billion, limiting access to climate finance and sustainable agriculture incentives.

## Solution Overview

**CarbonTrack AI** is a WhatsApp-based MRV platform that automates carbon credit verification using computer vision and satellite imagery, reducing costs to $0.50/farmer/year while maintaining international registry compliance.

##  Key Innovation

### 1. WhatsApp-First Approach
- Leverages India's most popular messaging platform (500M+ users)
- Zero training required - farmers already know how to use it
- Multi-language support (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu)
- Works on any smartphone with basic internet

### 2. Real Computer Vision Implementation
- **OpenCV-based tree detection** using HSV color segmentation
- **Contour analysis** for identifying tree-like shapes
- **Vegetation coverage calculation** for biomass estimation
- **Confidence scoring** based on image quality metrics

### 3. IPCC-Compliant Carbon Calculations
- **Allometric equations** from Chave et al. (2014) research
- **Above and Below Ground Biomass** calculations
- **Wood density adjustments** for different agro-climatic zones
- **Uncertainty quantification** (¬±15-25% range) following IPCC Tier 2 methodology

### 4. Blockchain-Style Verification
- **SHA-256 hashing** for immutable record creation
- **Audit trail functionality** for all submissions
- **Third-party verification** workflow integration
- **Status tracking** (pending/verified) with timestamps

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Computer Vision Pipeline
```python
# HSV color segmentation for vegetation detection
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_green, upper_green)

# Morphological operations for noise reduction
kernel = np.ones((5,5), np.uint8)
mask = cv2.morphologyEx(mask, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)

# Contour detection for tree counting
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```

### Carbon Calculation Methodology
```python
# IPCC Tier 2 Allometric Equation (Chave et al. 2014)
# AGB = 0.673 √ó (œÅ √ó D¬≤)^0.976
agb_per_tree = 0.673 * ((wood_density * diameter**2)**0.976) / 1000

# Total biomass calculation
total_biomass = agb + (agb * bgb_ratio)  # Include below-ground biomass

# Carbon content (IPCC default: 47%)
carbon_credits = total_biomass * 0.47 * (44/12) / 1000  # Convert to CO2 tons
```

### Database Architecture
```sql
-- Farmers table with unique constraints
CREATE TABLE farmers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT UNIQUE,
    location TEXT,
    registered_date TEXT
);

-- Submissions with verification tracking
CREATE TABLE submissions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    farmer_id INTEGER,
    tree_count INTEGER,
    biomass_tons REAL,
    carbon_credits REAL,
    uncertainty_percent REAL,
    verification_hash TEXT,
    satellite_confirmed BOOLEAN,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    timestamp TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (farmer_id) REFERENCES farmers (id)
);
```
