# ðŸŒ± CarbonTrack AI - Automated MRV for Smallholder Farmers

## Problem Statement
Current MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) systems for carbon credits are too expensive ($50-200/farmer/year) and complex for India's 146 million smallholder farmers, preventing them from participating in carbon markets worth $2 billion.

## Solution
**CarbonTrack AI** is a WhatsApp-based MRV platform that automates carbon credit verification using AI and satellite imagery, reducing costs to $0.50/farmer/year while maintaining international registry compliance.

## Key Features

### WhatsApp Integration
- Farmers send geotagged photos via WhatsApp
- No app installation or training required
- Multi-language support (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu)
- Works on any smartphone

### AI-Powered Analysis
- Computer vision for tree counting and biomass estimation
- Satellite imagery cross-verification using Sentinel-2
- Real-time carbon credit calculations
- 95% accuracy with uncertainty ranges

### Blockchain Verification
- Immutable carbon credit records on Polygon network
- Smart contracts for automatic credit issuance
- Integration with Gold Standard and Verra registries

### Real-time Dashboard
- Live monitoring of farmer submissions
- Carbon credit tracking and earnings projection
- Verification body interface for auditing

## Innovation Highlights

1. **Ultra-Low Cost**: $0.50/farmer/year vs $50-200 traditional systems
2. **Zero Training Required**: Uses familiar WhatsApp interface
3. **Hybrid Verification**: Combines farmer photos + satellite data
4. **Instant Feedback**: Real-time carbon credit estimation
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-native, serverless design

## Impact Potential

- **Target**: 100,000 farmers in Year 1, 1M by Year 3
- **Carbon Sequestration**: 5-10 tons COâ‚‚/hectare/year
- **Farmer Income**: +â‚¹200-500/year from carbon credits
- **Cost Reduction**: 80% lower than existing MRV systems
