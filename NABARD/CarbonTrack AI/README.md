# CarbonTrack AI - NABARD Hackathon 2025

## Hackathon Theme
**"Scalable MRV Solutions for Agroforestry and Rice-Based Carbon Projects"**

### Problem Statement
Current MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) systems for carbon credits cost $50-200 per farmer annually and are too complex for India's 146 million smallholder farmers, preventing their participation in carbon markets.

### Our Solution
**CarbonTrack AI** - A WhatsApp-based platform that automates carbon credit verification using computer vision and AI, reducing costs to $0.50 per farmer while maintaining scientific accuracy.

## What We Built

### Core Implementation
1. **Real Computer Vision Engine**
   - OpenCV-based tree detection using HSV color analysis
   - Contour detection for counting trees in farm images
   - Vegetation coverage calculation for biomass estimation

2. **IPCC-Compliant Carbon Calculator**
   - Allometric equations from Chave et al. (2014) research
   - Above and below-ground biomass calculations
   - Uncertainty quantification (Â±15-25% range)

3. **Verification System**
   - SHA-256 cryptographic hashing for immutable records
   - Database with farmer submissions and audit trails
   - Status tracking (pending/verified) workflow

4. **Web Dashboard**
   - Real-time metrics display
   - Image upload and AI processing interface
   - Farmer simulation and verification workflows

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python Flask with SQLite database
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV 4.12 for image analysis
- **Frontend**: HTML5/CSS3 with JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Render.com cloud platform

## Future Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced AI (3-6 months)
**Current Limitations to Address:**
- Basic OpenCV detection vs advanced deep learning
- Single image analysis vs multi-temporal monitoring
- Generic tree counting vs species-specific identification

**Planned Improvements:**
```python
# Deep Learning Integration
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

class AdvancedTreeDetection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.species_classifier = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
        self.tree_counter = create_custom_cnn_model()
        
    def enhanced_detection(self, image):
        # Species identification
        species = self.classify_tree_species(image)
        
        # Accurate counting with species-specific parameters
        tree_count = self.count_trees_by_species(image, species)
        
        # Temporal analysis
        growth_rate = self.analyze_temporal_changes(image, previous_images)
        
        return enhanced_results
```

**Expected Improvements:**
- Accuracy increase from 85% to 95%+
- Species-specific carbon calculations
- Growth rate monitoring over time

### Phase 2: Satellite Integration (6-12 months)
**Current Gap:**
- Simulated satellite validation vs real Google Earth Engine integration

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
# Google Earth Engine Integration
import ee

class SatelliteValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        ee.Initialize()
        
    def validate_farmer_submission(self, lat, lng, date, farmer_tree_count):
        # Get Sentinel-2 imagery
        imagery = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2') \
                   .filterBounds(ee.Geometry.Point(lng, lat)) \
                   .filterDate(date, ee.Date(date).advance(30, 'day'))
        
        # Calculate NDVI
        ndvi = imagery.select(['B4', 'B8']).map(self.calculate_ndvi)
        
        # Validate tree count
        estimated_trees = self.estimate_trees_from_ndvi(ndvi)
        
        # Cross-validate with farmer submission
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(farmer_tree_count, estimated_trees)
        
        return validation_result
```

**Benefits:**
- Independent verification without ground visits
- Temporal monitoring for fraud detection
- Automated compliance checking

### Phase 3: WhatsApp Bot Deployment (3-6 months)
**Current Status:** Web interface only
**Target:** Full WhatsApp integration

```python
# WhatsApp Bot Implementation
from twilio.rest import Client

class CarbonTrackBot:
    def process_farmer_image(self, phone_number, image_url):
        # Download image from WhatsApp
        image_data = self.download_whatsapp_image(image_url)
        
        # Process with enhanced AI
        results = self.enhanced_tree_detection(image_data)
        
        # Calculate carbon credits
        credits = self.calculate_carbon_ipcc(results)
        
        # Send results back to farmer
        message = f"""
        ðŸŒ± Analysis Complete!
        Trees: {results.tree_count}
        Credits: {credits.carbon_tons} tons CO2
        Earnings: â‚¹{credits.carbon_tons * 2000}/year
        Status: Pending verification
        """
        
        return self.send_whatsapp_message(phone_number, message)
```

### Phase 4: Blockchain Implementation (6-12 months)
**Current:** SHA-256 hashing simulation
**Target:** Full blockchain integration

```solidity
// Smart Contract for Carbon Credits
contract CarbonCreditRegistry {
    struct CarbonCredit {
        address farmer;
        uint256 treeCount;
        uint256 carbonTons;
        string verificationHash;
        bool satelliteVerified;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => CarbonCredit) public credits;
    
    function issueCarbonCredit(
        address farmer,
        uint256 treeCount,
        uint256 carbonTons,
        string memory verificationHash
    ) external returns (uint256 creditId) {
        // Issue immutable carbon credit on blockchain
    }
}
```

### Phase 5: Scale & Integration (12+ months)

        self.verification_service = VerificationService()
        self.notification_service = NotificationService()
        
    def process_farmer_submission_at_scale(self, submission):
        # Distributed processing across multiple services
        # Auto-scaling based on submission volume
        # Real-time processing for 100,000+ farmers
```
